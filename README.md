# :pushpin: Academic Project in Digital Economy and New Business Models
##### Introduction
In order to develop a business analytics approach, I need to work on a real-world situation.
##### Objectives
The project involves identifying a real-world business problem or opportunity and designing and implementing an analysis plan to address it using at least one of the modelling methods studied in the course. I am free to choose any business problem or opportunity or public policy issue that you consider challenging and useful to address using business analytics.

The data that I use should be readily available and verifiable.
Some examples of business problems or opportunities. Develop a model to:

* explain and predict sales
* explain and predict salary
* explain and predict churn, … 

##### Restriction of my data set
My data set should be made of a minimum of 50 observations and contains both quantitative and qualitative variables. You can find or build data sets from many online sources. 

##### Presentation
I have to upload a zip file named name1-name2.zip with :
* my python project (data sets and script) file
* my ppt presentation will detail:
* aim of the project and data source
* how my data have been cleaned and/or recoded
* descriptive statistics and/or graph on each variable
* methodology used: from classical regression (linear/logit) to GAM
* results and comparison of prediction accuracy
* conclusion
